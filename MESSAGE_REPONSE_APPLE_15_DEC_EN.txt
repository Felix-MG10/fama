Hello,

Thank you for your feedback. We have identified the issue with the screenshots.

We will immediately update all screenshots for iPhone 6.5" and iPad 13" in App Store Connect to accurately reflect the current app interface with all recent UI changes and corrections.

The new screenshots will:
- Show the current interface with all UI fixes applied
- Highlight the app's main features and functionality
- Use the correct device frames (iPhone frame for iPhone, iPad frame for iPad)
- Accurately represent the app in use on each supported device

We will upload the updated screenshots in App Store Connect → "View All Sizes in Media Manager" for both iPhone 6.5" Display and iPad Pro (12.9-inch) before resubmission.

Thank you for your patience.

Best regards,
Fama Development Team
