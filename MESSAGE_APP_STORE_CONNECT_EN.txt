1. Guideline 4.0 - Design (iPad User Interface)

Issue Identified:
The user interface was still cluttered on iPad Air 11-inch (M3), making the app difficult to use. Specifically, text within buttons was overlapping with the button frames.

Corrections Applied:

1. Login Screen:
- Container width increased: 600px → 700px to avoid clutter
- Padding increased: 40px → 48px (compliant with Apple HIG recommendations of minimum 16 points)
- Margins increased: 100px horizontal → 120px, 50px vertical → 60px
- Logo enlarged: 60px → 70px height for better visibility
- Vertical spacing increased: +50% between elements for more breathing room

2. Social Login Buttons (CRITICAL FIX):
- Minimum height: 56px on iPad (compliant with Apple HIG)
- Internal padding increased: Sufficient spacing around text and icons (minimum 16 points on each side)
- Font size adapted: Automatic reduction on iPad to prevent overflow and overlapping
- Text overflow handling: TextOverflow.ellipsis and maxLines to prevent text from overlapping the frame
- Minimum button width: Ensured so text doesn't overflow
- Icons enlarged: 24px on iPad (instead of 20px) for better visibility
- Text-frame spacing: Sufficient horizontal and vertical padding so text remains properly centered in the button

3. Responsive Layout:
- Automatic iPad detection: isTablet() method detects iOS iPads (width >= 768 points)
- Dynamic adaptation: All elements automatically adapt according to device type
- Sufficient spacing: Minimum 16 points between all interactive elements (Apple HIG)

4. Tabs:
- Overflow handling: TextOverflow.ellipsis on all texts
- Adapted font size: Automatic reduction on iPad
- Increased padding: Sufficient spacing between tabs

5. Screens Fixed:
- Login - Login screen (major corrections)
- Dashboard - Main navigation
- Order Screen - Running/Subscription/History tabs
- Favourite Screen - Food/Restaurants tabs
- Search Screen - Food/Restaurants tabs
